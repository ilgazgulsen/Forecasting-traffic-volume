# Forecasting Traffic Volume Using R

This project focuses on forecasting traffic volume using various statistical and machine learning models in R. It was developed as part of a bachelor's project and includes advanced data preprocessing, feature engineering, seasonality analysis, and model comparison.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

To forecast hourly traffic volume using multiple linear regression and ARIMA models, while incorporating trend and seasonality components from time series data.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset includes hourly traffic volume and weather data. It contains date-time, temperature, holiday flags, weather descriptions, and traffic counts. The dataset is divided into a training set (before 2018) and a test set (2018 onward).

## ðŸ”§ Techniques Used

- **Time series decomposition**: trend modeling via linear regression and moving averages
- **Seasonality modeling**: hour effect, day effect, weekday-hour interaction
- **Multiple Linear Regression (LM)**: several versions with different feature sets
- **ARIMA**: classical time series modeling
- **ARIMA with regressors**: time series forecasting using external variables
- **Model averaging**: final predictions are generated by averaging outputs of five models

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)  
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)

## ðŸ§ª Final Forecast

The final prediction is generated for 2018-10-01 using five models and then averaged to increase robustness.

## ðŸ›  Libraries Used

- `data.table`
- `forecast`
- `base`
- `stats`

## ðŸ“Œ Highlights

- Feature engineering for time-based components like hour, day, weekday
- ARIMA with external regressors (ARIMAX)
- Multi-model prediction blending
- Visual analysis of trend and seasonality components
